# DontEatAlone
Android application development Final Project

An application to find people who want a partner to eat with at some restaurant.

Users can post an invitation with time, date and restaurant name on the platform.

Each post will be uploaded to the Firebase. 

When another user accepts the invitation, a notification from Firebase will be sent to the original poster.

Other actions such as the invitation expired or the partner reject an accepted invitation will also send a notification to the original poster from Firebase.
